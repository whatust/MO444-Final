\section{Introduction}

This project will focus on the problem of Web Traffic Time Series Forecasting hosted on Kaggle \cite{kaggle}.
The problem focuses on the problem of forecasting the future values of multiple time series. Sequential or temporal observations emerge in many key real-world problems, ranging from biological data, financial markets, weather forecasting, to audio and video processing. The field of time series encapsulates many different problems, ranging from analysis and inference to classification and forecast. On our project we will forecast future web traffic for approximately Wikipedia pages, with a dataset provided by Kaggle \cite{kaggle_data}.

\section{Proposed Solutions}

\section{Experiments and Discussion}

The experiments carried out and the obtained
results.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

The main conclusions of the work as well as some future directions for other people interested in continuing this work.
